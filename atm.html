        <h2>What is ATM</h2>
        <p class="ATM">
            ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet and is a 3 year computer program at Bancroft Middle School. In ATM, we are introduced to different programs on the computer and get to use them, know them, and make projects with them.

        <h2>My ATM Experience</h2>
        <p class="ATM">
            Ive been in ATM for 3 years and I had fun doing ATM, photoshop was one of the best programs as well as coding! I like coding my websites because it shows my own interests and what I like to do.

        <h2>Reflection On ATM</h2>
        <p class="ATM">Overall, the ATM program has been very helpful to me. I am able to learn and discover new programs that I havenâ€™t done or heard of. ATM has been useful to me to other classes like English, history, and science. ATM is very helpful for any future job. Every year, the world is getting more and more advance through technology. I think students with an interest in computers will enjoy learning and exploring new programs that ATM offers. If the students that are serious about joining atm want to succeed in computer technology this is a great way to help your career.</p>
